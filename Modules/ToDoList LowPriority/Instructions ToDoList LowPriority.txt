How to use the To Do List Max Patch:

The purpose of this patch is to create screen shots and store them in a predetermined file. To set this file hole the escape key while turning the program on.
Alternatively you can send it the path when you send the message ToDoListSend which will take the screenshot and save it at the path you tell it.

1) The message is composed on 'ToDoListInfo' 'ToDoListTag'
a) ToDoListInfo sends the message in this box plus any previously pressed 'ToDoListTag'
2) ToDoListSend sends the message; if it contains a ':' then it will be routed to send the screenshot to a different path
 - ex: ToDoListSend (is the recieve object); and the message is 'C:/users/desktop/ToDoListFolder/'; this will save to that folder.
**make sure to include the last backslash**
