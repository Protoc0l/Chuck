Purpose: A more customizable stream deck program that can utilize more types of button press actions (such as down press, shortup release or longup release of a button), better integrate with python & windows command prompt, provide non-streamdeck devices (such as a midi foot pedal or video game buttons) access to actions previously only accessible to a stream deck, and provide a virtual stream deck for those without a physical stream deck device.
